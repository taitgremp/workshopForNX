### üßµ Lab 14 - Workspace schematics - Modifying files

###### ‚è∞ Estimated time: 25-35 minutes

#### üìö Learning outcomes:

- Explore some more advanced, real-world usages of schematics
- Understand how to modify existing source code with schematics

#### üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Steps :

1. Generate another schematic called `sort-project-references`

2. As a start let's make it increment the `"version"` number in our `workspace.json` file:

   <details>
   <summary>üê≥ Hint</summary>

    - Refer to the [docs](https://nx.dev/latest/angular/workspace/schematics/workspace-schematics#creating-custom-rules)
    - Use these utilities: 
        - `import { updateJsonInTree } from '@nrwl/workspace';`
        - `import { chain } from '@angular-devkit/schematics';`
    - As always, the answer is in the [the solution](INC-VERSION-SOLUTION.md). Try a few different approaches on your own first. 
   </details>
   
   ‚ö†Ô∏è When you run the above, it might complain that you haven't supplied a `name`. Since
   we don't need this property in the schematic, you can remove it from the schema.

3. While what we just built above could we useful on its own - let's say whenever we want to release or deploy new versions of packages in our workspace..
Let's build something even more useful:
    - When large teams work in the same workspace, they will occasionally be adding new libs in their PRs
    - Because these libs get added at the end of our `workspace.json` projects list, they can be a source of merge conflicts. All these PRs will be modifying the same file
    - If there was an easy way developers could sort the `projects` list in their `workspace.json` file before pushing the PR - it would reduce the chance of a merge conflict, as the changes would happen
    at different places in the file.
    
    **Modify your schematic so it sorts the value of `projects` in `workspace.json` by key**.
    
    ‚ö†Ô∏è You can use the function provided in the Hint to sort the keys of an object
    
   <details>
   <summary>üê≥ Hint</summary>

    ```typescript
    function sortObjectKeys(obj: any) {
      const sorted = {};
      Object.keys(obj).sort().forEach(key => {
        sorted[key] = obj[key];
      });
      return sorted;
    }
    ```
     
   </details>

2. `nx.json` also has a `projects` property vulnerable to merge conflicts. Let's sort it as well part of our above schematic.

3. Finally, it's good practice to have your schematic run your modified files through Prettier after modifying them.

    - Use the `import { formatFiles } from '@nrwl/workspace';`
    - As the last rule at the end of your chain

4. Run your schematic and notice the resulting changes. Commit your changes so you start fresh on your next lab.

5. **BONUS** - If you finish early, open up `tsconfig.base.json`

    You'll notice its `compilerOptions/paths` property also contains all the projects in our
    workspace. Try to sort this as well as part of your schematic.
    
    Another one you can look at is the root `jest.config.js` - this will be interesting as it's a `.js` file.

6. **BONUS BONUS** - use a tool like [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) to run your
schematic automatically before each commit. This will ensure developers never forget to sort
their workspace files.
